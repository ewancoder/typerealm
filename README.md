# TypeRealm

This is the game that you control with your keyboard only. The realm of typing.

## Design and goals

The goal is to create a game that will be suitable for the following:

- training tool for learning touch typing
- multiplayer support to compete in typing skill

### Training tool

The difficulty of the game should be adaptable for the skill of the player. The
game should contain training elements that can facilitate touch typing learning.

### Multiplayer support

The game should contain multiplayer support so many people can compete against
each other. More people - more fun :)
